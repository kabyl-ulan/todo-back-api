This project is created as a todo-list API. To create the API, we used [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en), [Express.js](https://github.com/expressjs/express) and [Postgresql](https://node-postgres.com/).

## Getting Started

1. First download files.
2. On postgresql, create a database named api and a table named users.
3. Run this command in the project directory to install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

4. You can run dev server with the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn run dev
```

5. Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) with your browser to see the result.
